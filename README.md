## Motivation
Over 5% of the world’s population(430 million people) require rehabilitation to address their ‘disabling’ hearing loss (432 million adults and 34 million children). 
They more often than not have imperfect development of speech & language
It is estimated that by 2050 over 700 million people – or one in every ten people – will have disabling hearing loss.

People with hearing disabilities regularly face difficulties while having conversations on different occasions. 
A hearing aid is a wonderful device, helpful for those people whose hearing disabilities can be cured using it and those who can afford it. But a lot of people’s disabilities cannot be cured using a hearing aid or they cannot afford it. For such people, the only option is either communicating using sign language and using lip-reading or a combination of both.

Sign language has evolved manifolds over the years and it allows for effective communication but the huge catch is not many people in the world sign language primarily because it is not that easy to learn and can take years to gain even a passable proficiency. 

Now the benefit of lip reading is that the other person does not need to learn sign language to communicate and they can do so by correctly enunciating their speech. 

## Features

Our App focuses on helping such people by features like “**Lip Reading Tutorial**”, ”**Sign Language Tutorial**”. These features help them practice and improvise their abilities to understand whatever the other person is saying while having a real conversation. 

On the other hand, “**Speech Assistance**” features help us know how fast or slow we are talking so that we can change the speed accordingly to give a better presentation. 

While watching videos a person with a hearing disability often can’t understand what the person is trying to convey because lip-reading at that pace is almost next to impossible. The feature “**Video Transcript**” generates auto-subtitles and can help them better understand the context of the video.


## Softwares and Libraries Used:
 - Python 
 - Flask  
 - SQLAlchemy 
 - HTML5 
 - CSS3 
 - Javascript
 - Bootstrap
 - Pyaudio

# Future Enhancements:

## Lip Reading and Sign Language
In the lip reading part the tutorial only focuses on single words, but it can be extended to a sentence to provide advanced exercises and the same can be implemented for sign language. 

## Speech Assistance
There can be added functionality where a text to speech engine first converts the text entered to speech and then a human face that enunciates clearly how to speak that sentence. This will help users imitate the same sounds and thus improve their pronunciation capabilities.

## Transcript
The major problem with the transcript feature was the inefficiency of the speech-to-text engine as it’s a multi-step process of first extracting the audio from the video and then parsing the audio to generate text. This currently makes the text lag 6-7 seconds behind the video but it can be improved significantly!


# Steps to Run it locally:

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system to run the application. 
Also install venv library to install the dependencies in a virtual environment using the command:
pip install venv

## Steps:

1. First download the zipped folder Code.zip and then unzip it. 
2. Open a Command Prompt/Terminal and navigate to the folder where you have unzipped it and enter that directory.
3. Create a virtual environment using the following commands:
   `virtualenv  t4sne`
4. Then to activate the environment type:
   For windows:
   `t4sne\Scrips\activate`

   For Mac/Linux:
   `source t4sne/bin/activate`
   Now type the following to install all the dependencies:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
   Wait for it to install everything.
5. Next type:
   `pipwin install pyaudio`
6. Now finally run:
   `python application.py`

Finally, open any browser and type in localhost:5000 or 127.0.0.1:500
